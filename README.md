## What I do...
I code, make music, and draw.

### I code in:

![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=haxe,haxeflixel,java)

I used to mod a game called Friday Night Funkin (fnf for short,) But I'm not available for any mods anymore. I'm getting deep into game development, and I'm loving it.

### Projects I'm working on
- I'm currently working on a game development team. We need more people though,and if you want to join, DM me on discord! The team is called Synth Studio.
- Synth Studio is currently working on an FNF fangame called Groovin' Every Night, made in Haxeflixel.
- I'm working on my own take of Hatsune Miku Project Diva, but for mobile and desktop and it's easily moddable, even supporting dsc files natively. It's called [VoxMania](https://github.com/ZSolarSev/VoxMaina), go check it out!
- I'm working on an AI assisted Vocal Synthesizer which is made to be DiffSinger but it's faster and much easier to make voicebanks with similar it not the same level of quality.

### Possibilities of future projects
- I may or may not have figured out how to replicate the human brain with neural networks?? It's definetly not at the same level of detail, but its a rough replicate. Its made from many structured neural networks strung together by semi-deterministic logic. It's super complex, and I have some paragraphs which go into detail. I won't share it here, but I still wonder if it'll work...
- I'm possibly gonna make a raytracer which acts like a path tracer but instead of random sampling, i'm using some custom importance sampling. It's quite complex, so I won't explain here, but that's a thing. Also i've been thinking of a way to draw caustics which instead of low rays -> horrible caustics, low rays -> less realistic but still nice caustics. It's complicated and my theory isn't complete, but it's a possibility.

### Music/Art
About art, I'm currently learning it. I've gotten a bit of progress, and I'm doing great on paper. I can draw poses, characters, hair, heads, and a lot more, and I usually use an anime style. I still need more practice with digital, though. About my music, I'm also learning it, but I'm a lot more experienced. About 2 years to be more specific. I don't really make fnf songs anymore, it's rare. I'm trying a lot of new styles of music at the moment.
