## What I do...
I code, make music, and I'm learning art and 3d modeling.

I code in Haxeflixel and Psych Engine Lua. I mod a game called Friday Night Funkin (fnf for short,) But I'm not available for any mods right now. I'm actually working on a lot more projects then intended, and I'm kinda sad about that. I want to get into game development, but It seems that ill be very busy before I can get to what I really want to do. :< Me and some friends also plan on working on a team called "Synth Productions," however it hasn't really been fully created yet. In fact the idea of managing a team of people sounded dreading to me, so I passed ownership to my more fnf mod friend. He will most likely make it an fnf team, so I don't know what I will do about that.

About art, I'm currently learning it. Ive gotten a bit of progress, but nothing so major I would like to show it. So instead, I'll talk about my music. I'm also learning it, but I'm a lot more expirenced. About 1.5 years to be more specific. I don't really make fnf songs, but I'm trying to get more into hip pop, but mainly edm music. About 3d modeling, Its a lot easier than I was expecting! I actually modeled a soda can with a face like 3 days through learning blender, and I did it without a tutorial! I even modeled the extruding section for the face, the details of the top/bottom of the can, and even the straw. Its all low poly as im not yet ready to make anything actually detailed, but I think I'm doing pretty well with blender.

## What I'm learning...
I'm attempting to learn art, and figure out what path I want to take for game development. Like what programming language, wether I want to be indie, wether I want to make a team, etc. I'm also trying to learn blender, which is going a lot better than expected.
