# Hey There! I'm ZSolarDev, Solar for short.
This is my github profile! If you want to contact me, do so at my discord, [@zsolar1](https://discordapp.com/users/1067570067790893208).

## What I do...
I code, make music, draw, and I'm learning blender.

### I code in:

![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=haxe,haxeflixel)

I used to mod a game called Friday Night Funkin (fnf for short,) But I'm not available for any mods. I'm getting deep into game development, and I'm loving it.

### Projects I'm working on
- I'm currently working on a game development team. We're getting people, but we're kinda short on coders. If you code in haxe/haxeflixel and want to join, DM me on discord! The team is called Synth Productions.
- I'm working on this game with a friend called [Discordant](https://github.com/ChickenSwimmer2020/Discordant). We have a lot planned, check it out!
- I'm working on a game with Synth Productions called Twilight Rift. It's in its early stages, and the repository is private. I'll put updates when needed!

### Possibilities of future projects
- I may or may not have figured out how to replicate the human brain with neural networks?? It's definetly not at the same level of detail, but its a rough replicate. Its made from many structured neural networks strung together by semi-deterministic logic. It's super complex, and I have some paragraphs which go into detail. I won't share it here, but I still wonder if it'll work...
- I'm possibly gonna make a raytracer which acts like a path tracer but instead of random sampling, i'm using some custom importance sampling. It's quite complex, so I won't explain here, but that's a thing. Also i've been thinking of a way to draw caustics which instead of low rays -> horrible caustics, low rays -> less realistic but still nice caustics. It's complicated and my theory isn't complete, but it's a possibility.
- I'm thinking of something that converts waves to signals, like an fft. It's possible in theory. It should produce naturally smaller output, but it leads to longer encoding times. I wonder if I can prototype it?

### Art
About art, I'm currently learning it. I've gotten a bit of progress, but nothing so major I would like to show it. So instead, I'll talk about my music. I'm also learning it, but I'm a lot more experienced. About 1.5 years to be more specific. I don't really make fnf songs, but I'm trying to get more into hip hop/trap, but mainly edm music.

About 3d modeling, Its a lot easier than I was expecting! I actually modeled a soda can with a face like 3 days through learning blender, and I did it without a tutorial! I even modeled the extruding section for the face, the details of the top/bottom of the can, and even the straw. Its all low poly as im not yet ready to make anything actually detailed, but I think I'm doing pretty well with blender.

## ![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cpp)
I'm actually learning a new programming language: c++. I'm learning it because a lot of AAA games were built on it. It also has many popular frameworks and libraries, and has a huge community behind it. It took about 2 hours to get a project that says hello world in a console. the reason it took 2 hours was:
1. Visual Studio takes actual CENTURIES to update
2. Visual Studio also takes CENTURIES to install c++ support
3. Installing SDL for Visual Studio was such a pain. I fr almost started crying, but chatgpt came in cluch. Not even youtube or google could help.

I'm just glad I have it installed. hopefully I don't have to go through that again. But I'm still getting used to things like headers, incudes, syntax, etc. If you can help me on discord from 5-9:30pm EST, then please contact me. Honestly, this language is gonna take a hot minute to understand. Learning c# syntax wasn't too bad, because haxe syntax was really similar. With c++ though, It's something else. It's so different that very little knowledge can carry over. Thank you for reading all of this, it's a lot of stuff. :D
