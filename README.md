## What I do...
I code, make music, and I'm learning art and 3d modeling.

I code in:

I used to mod a game called Friday Night Funkin (fnf for short,) But I'm not available for any mods. I'm only working on 1 mod, and it's a mod with my friends called Untitled Friend Mod. That will be the final fnf mod I work on, as I'm getting deep into game development, and I'm loving it.

About art, I'm currently learning it. I've gotten a bit of progress, but nothing so major I would like to show it. So instead, I'll talk about my music. I'm also learning it, but I'm a lot more experienced. About 1.5 years to be more specific. I don't really make fnf songs, but I'm trying to get more into hip hop/trap, but mainly edm music.

## What I'm learning...
I'm attempting to learn art, and figure out what path I want to take for game development. Like whether I want to be indie, whether I want to make a team, etc. I'm also trying to learn blender, which is going a lot better than expected.

About 3d modeling, Its a lot easier than I was expecting! I actually modeled a soda can with a face like 3 days through learning blender, and I did it without a tutorial! I even modeled the extruding section for the face, the details of the top/bottom of the can, and even the straw. Its all low poly as im not yet ready to make anything actually detailed, but I think I'm doing pretty well with blender.

## ![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cpp)
I'm actually learning a new programming language: c++. I'm learning it because a lot of AAA games were built on it. It also has many popular frameworks and libraries, and has a huge community behind it. It took about 2 hours to get a project that says hello world in a console. the reason it took 2 hours was:
1. Visual Studio takes actual CENTURIES to update
2. Visual Studio also takes CENTURIES to install c++ support
3. Installing SDL for Visual Studio was such a pain. I fr almost started crying, but chatgpt came in cluch. Not even youtube or google could help.

I'm just glad I have it installed. hopefully I don't have to go through that again. But I'm still getting used to things like headers, incudes, syntax, etc. If you can help me on discord from 5-9:30pm EST, then please contact me. Honestly, this language is gonna take a hot minute to understand. Learning c# syntax wasn't too bad, because haxeflixel syntax was really similar. With c++ though, It's something else. It's so different that very little knowledge can carry over. Thank you for reading all of this, it's a lot of stuff. :D
